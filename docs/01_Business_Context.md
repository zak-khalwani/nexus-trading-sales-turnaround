# 1. Business Context: The Nexus Trading Co. Case Study

This document provides a detailed background on the business drivers, strategic goals, and target audience for the Nexus Trading Co. Sales Performance Dashboard.

## Problem Statement

Nexus Trading Co., a mid-sized international distributor, found its growth stalling due to a lack of data-driven insights. The company's sales data was siloed in various systems, and reporting consisted of static, manually-compiled spreadsheets. This resulted in a critical information gap for the leadership team, who were unable to perform timely analysis or make strategic decisions with confidence.

Key unanswered questions included:
*   **Profitability vs. Revenue:** Are we pursuing revenue at the expense of our profit margins?
*   **Channel Effectiveness:** Which of our sales channels—Wholesale, Distributor, or Export—delivers the most value?
*   **The 80/20 Rule:** Which 20% of our products, customers, and stores are driving 80% of our profits?
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** How are we performing against our historical data from last year?

## Project Goals & Objectives

The primary goal was to create a dynamic and centralized analytics dashboard to transform Nexus Trading Co. into a data-forward organization. The specific objectives were:

*   **Create a Single Source of Truth:** Consolidate all key sales metrics into one reliable, automated dashboard.
*   **Enable Self-Service BI:** Empower managers to explore data and find answers independently, reducing reliance on the IT department for custom reports.
*   **Track Strategic KPIs:** Monitor not just `Total Sales`, but also `Profit Margin`, `Average Transaction Value`, and their year-over-year growth.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Design visuals that allow users to easily slice data by time, product, customer, store location, and sales channel to uncover the "why" behind the numbers.

## Target Audience

This dashboard was designed for strategic and tactical decision-makers within Nexus Trading Co.:

*   **C-Level Executives (CEO, CSO):** For a high-level overview of business health and long-term strategic planning.
*   **Sales Directors/VPs:** To monitor overall team performance, set regional targets, and allocate resources effectively.
*   **Store Managers & Regional Leads:** To track their specific performance against company benchmarks and identify local opportunities for growth.
